        <h2>Computer System</h2>
        <p>
            A computer system is an integrated set of hardware and software designed to process data into useful information. 
            It includes physical components such as the CPU, memory, input/output devices, and storage, working together 
            with system software like operating systems and application programs. Computer systems perform complex operations 
            at incredible speeds and are designed to be reliable, scalable, and efficient. They support various functions 
            from basic tasks like word processing to complex scientific simulations. The architecture of a computer system 
            determines how the components interact and share resources. Today, they play a vital role in business, education, 
            healthcare, and nearly every part of modern life.

        <h2>Input and Output System</h2>
        <p>
            Input and output systems are essential for user interaction with a computer. Input devices allow users to 
            provide data and instructions (e.g., keyboard, mouse, scanner), while output devices display results 
            (e.g., monitor, printer, speakers). These systems bridge the human-computer interface. Input devices send 
            information to the CPU, which processes it, and output devices present the outcome. They ensure smooth 
            communication between the machine and the user, making computers usable and effective in real-world tasks.

        <h2>Motherboard</h2>
        <p>
            The motherboard is the main circuit board of a computer that connects and allows communication between 
            all components. It houses the CPU, memory, chipset, and connectors for storage, graphics, and peripherals. 
            It acts like the central nervous system, distributing power and signals to components. Without the 
            motherboard, no component in the system could work in unison.

        <h2>Cache and Registry</h2>
        <p>
            Cache is a small, fast memory located inside or close to the CPU that stores frequently used instructions 
            for quick access. It is categorized into three levels:
            <br><strong>L1 Cache:</strong> Closest to the CPU core, fastest but smallest.  
            <br><strong>L2 Cache:</strong> Slightly larger and slower than L1, still close to the core.  
            <br><strong>L3 Cache:</strong> Shared among cores, largest and slowest of the three but still faster than RAM.
            <br>The registry is a Windows-based hierarchical database that stores low-level settings for the operating system 
            and installed applications. It keeps configuration details and settings.

        <h2>Summary of Chapter</h2>
        <p>
            This chapter introduced the fundamental building blocks of a computer system including its architecture, 
            input and output devices, the central role of the motherboard, and the importance of cache and registry. 
            It explained how various components interact to process data efficiently. Understanding these basics helps 
            students visualize how real-world computer systems work internally and externally.
