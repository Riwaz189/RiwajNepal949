        <h2>Operating System</h2>
        <p>
            An operating system (OS) is a software that acts as an interface between hardware and the user. It controls and manages 
            hardware resources such as the CPU, memory, storage devices, and input/output devices. OS provides a user interface 
            to interact with the computer and manages tasks such as file management, process scheduling, and security. 
            Examples of operating systems include Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux. The OS is the backbone of a computer, 
            enabling applications to run and providing an environment for users to interact with the system effectively. 
            It ensures the smooth execution of programs by managing resources efficiently and securely.

        <h2>Functions of Operating System</h2>
        <p>
            The operating system performs several crucial functions that are necessary for the efficient operation of a computer system. 
            Some of these functions include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Process Management:</strong> Manages processes in a system, including scheduling and multitasking.</li>
            <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong> Allocates and deallocates memory to various processes.</li>
            <li><strong>File Management:</strong> Organizes and controls access to files and directories.</li>
            <li><strong>Device Management:</strong> Controls hardware devices such as printers, hard drives, and network devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Security and Access Control:</strong> Protects system resources from unauthorized access.</li>
            <li><strong>Task Scheduling:</strong> Assigns CPU time to processes based on priorities.</li>
            <li><strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> Ensures that system resources are allocated efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Input/Output Management:</strong> Manages the flow of input and output between the computer and the user.</li>
            <li><strong>Error Detection and Handling:</strong> Monitors and handles errors in hardware and software.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Operating Systems</h2>
        <p>
            Operating systems can be categorized in several ways. Based on processing, we have:
            <br><strong>Single-tasking OS:</strong> Can handle one task at a time (e.g., early MS-DOS).
            <br><strong>Multitasking OS:</strong> Can handle multiple tasks simultaneously (e.g., modern Windows, Linux).
            <br>Based on user interface, the OS can be categorized as:
            <br><strong>Command-line Interface (CLI):</strong> The user interacts with the OS by typing commands (e.g., Linux terminal).
            <br><strong>Graphical User Interface (GUI):</strong> The user interacts with visual icons and menus (e.g., Windows, macOS).
        </p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Common Terms Used in Operating Systems</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Kernel:</strong> The core component of the OS that manages hardware and software resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Shell:</strong> The interface that allows users to interact with the kernel.</li>
            <li><strong>Process:</strong> A program in execution.</li>
            <li><strong>Thread:</strong> A smaller unit of a process that can be executed independently.</li>
            <li><strong>Virtual Memory:</strong> A memory management technique that uses disk storage to extend the apparent size of RAM.</li>
            <li><strong>File System:</strong> A system for organizing and storing files on storage devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Multitasking:</strong> Running multiple processes or programs simultaneously.</li>
            <li><strong>System Call:</strong> A request from a program to the operating system for a service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>QnAs</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Q1:</strong> What is an operating system and what are its main functions?<br><strong>Ans:</strong> An operating system is software that manages hardware and software resources, providing an interface for user interaction and performing tasks like memory management, file management, and process scheduling.</li>
            <li><strong>Q2:</strong> How does the operating system manage memory?<br><strong>Ans:</strong> The operating system allocates memory to different processes, manages the free space, and ensures that processes do not overwrite each otherâ€™s memory.</li>
            <li><strong>Q3:</strong> What is the difference between CLI and GUI operating systems?<br><strong>Ans:</strong> CLI requires users to input text commands, whereas GUI allows users to interact with visual elements such as icons and buttons.</li>
            <li><strong>Q4:</strong> Explain multitasking in operating systems.<br><strong>Ans:</strong> Multitasking allows an OS to execute multiple processes at the same time by quickly switching between tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Q5:</strong> What is the role of the kernel in an operating system?<br><strong>Ans:</strong> The kernel is the core part of the OS that manages system resources, including the CPU, memory, and hardware devices.</li>
